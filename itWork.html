        <h4 class="headings">What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h4>
        <p>The general work duties of this IT Professional cover a variety of roles. They encompass many facets of the business. Essentially, programming is the main function, but at the same time, it is also a minor part of the role. This person has greater responsibilities for the overall functioning of the business's IT services.  Ensuring the business is able to meet the demands of its customers on a daily basis and well into the future.</p>
        <p>The daily work may involve code development or debugging code. However, greater emphasise is on managing the environements that keep all of this running. He describes this as working with ERP Systems or Enterprise Resource Planning.</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning">ERP is usually referred to as a category of business management software—typically a suite of integrated applications—that an organization can use to collect, store, manage, and interpret data from many business activities.</blockquote>
        <p>The majority of these IT Systems are financial applications. They are, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Warehouse Management and Inventory Management systems. The environments in which these systems live, rely upon many other environments. These include, testing environments, development environments, and production environments. They are entrusted with consulting upon, managing, and developing these environments.</p>
        <p>In short, and I quote, "Yeah, so pretty much so pretty much everything technical I I'll look after...".</p>
        <h4 class="headings">What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</h4>
        <p>The companies IT Systems are largely owned by Microsoft. Often this leads to interactions with the technical and programming personnel from this company.</p>
        <p>When a challenging issue is raised without any real progress made on it, than he becomes the, 'esculation point' for support personnel, testing personnel and functional project management personnel. He is the 'Go-To' person.</p>
        <p>Most of all, other programmers, project managers, functional consultants, and other environment managers of the company are the chief interactions he has.</p>
        <p>He reports directly to a manager whom is a functional operations manager for the business. He has occasional dealings with senior management, but this rarely occurs.</p>
        <p>They do interact with third party software development companies and therefore the technical and programming personnel of these companies. </p>
        <p>He has no direct contact with customers or clients.</p>
        <h4 class="headings">Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h4>
        <p>This IT Professional spends the bulk of his time in an office environment. This can encompass a variety of areas. It is not just an office job. The company is spread out across a large geographical area. The interactions required of him result in considereable movements away from the main office. Meetings and technical interactions are often off site at the end users location. He is not pigeonholed as a programmer in a development capacity only. Managerial requirements demand many off site visitations and dealings with all levels of company personnel. </p>
        <h4 class="headings">What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h4>
        <p>In this role he is the 'Go-To' person. He is expected to know the answer to a problem. He does not always have the answer. This becomes the most challenging part of the job. He cannot esculate a problem to someone higher than himself. He must endeavour to find a solution on his own.</p>
        <p>In past job roles he was always able to find a more technical person than himself. Software houses always had other developers that he could interact with and bounce ideas off of. In this role, he is it. He is expected to solve the problem. </p>
        <p>Solving the more obscure or less known technical problems is the most challenging. Researching and investigating these issues is however, the most rewarding and most challenging part of the job.</p>
