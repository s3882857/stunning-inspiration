        <h1>Clouds, Servers and Services</h1>
        <p>By Justin Healy</p>
        <p>Cloud computing can be defined as renting computing services on demand. Whether that be storage, data base structures,
           online IT infrastructure or whole software solutions provided to a client. And it is generally offered as a pay as you
           go service(Ranger, S 2018, Microsoft Azure). Cloud computing as a service has grown significantly in recent years, and
           now represents more than a third of all IT spending(Ranger, S 2018). Cloud computing certainly is having and will have
           a great effect on the world of computing in times to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          The essence of cloud computing can be broken down into its three main categories. Infrastructure as a service, Platform
          as a service and Software as a service. Infrastructure as a service offers businesses the building blocks of computing
          essential for a business. Namely servers and networking. Eliminating the need for businesses to invest in costly
          hardware and maintenance of physical on-site infrastructure. This approach can also make it easy for seasonal expansion
          as the business will simply need to pay for what they use, without needing to pay costs year-round for on-site
          Infrastructure. It also reduce the staffing costs that would have been required if employers needed to maintain this
          on site hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          Platform as a service offers clients everything Infrastructure as a service offers, however with some added features
          like Operating System capability, development tools, business intelligence tools and data base management systems.
          Platforms are used primarily by developers and development teams to build, test, and implement applications.
          The advantage of using this platform is to decrease the amount of time and effort coding and developing structures
          that are now available. Some providers even offer pre coded components that can be incorporated existing. Some examples
          of these components would be the use of search boxes, security features and databases (Microsoft Azure PaaS).
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally, Software as a service offers clients a finished product ready to use for personal, business, or educational
          use. These applications are ready and connected to the cloud and offer everything cloud technology can offer. A great
          example of this would be Microsoft’s Office suite. Allowing users to store and create word documents, PowerPoint
          presentations and spreadsheets then save directly to their OneDrive account located in the cloud. This program can also
          be directly accessed via a web browser by logged in users. All computation and processing are then executed by the web
          browsers and remote servers hosted by Microsoft.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although as businesses hand over such large pieces of infrastructure to outside companies. Security will undoubtably
          become a larger issue. One such issue is a potential weakness in The Virtualisation Machines. Virtualisation allows
          multiple users access to one single machine, known as the host machine. In between the VM(Virtual Machine) there is
          software known widely as the Hypervisor. The Hypervisor distributes the resources of the host machine to how ever many
          VM’s are connected, spreading the resources as needed (Tsai et al., 2012, p. 32). However, Tsai et al highlight a
          potential floor within this framework known as VM hopping. An attacker could attain some access to other users using
          the same Host machine on alternate VM’s. The confidentiality could be compromised as the attacker can monitor the
          victim’s usage, modify the VM configurations, and access and delete stored data. This undermines the security of the
          VM in a very comprehensive way. Although for this attack to occur, both Virtual Machines would have to be connected to
          the same Host Machine and the alternate VM’s IP address must be known to the attacker. Why is this a noteworthy
          threat? Because many different VM’s run attached to a Host Machine simultaneously, and if IP confidentiality of
          these VM’s is compromised then VM hopping could potentially give attackers a very large opportunity to exploit
          the users in a damaging way (Tsai et al., 2012, p. 32).
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what’s to come for the Cloud market? Growth. Since the Covid-19 Epidemic businesses have seen a larger share of
          the work force working from home and cloud-based technology offers a simple solution to facilitate this change. And
          although the Covid-19 epidemic will not be here forever. Working from home for a large share of workers looks to be
          a reality of the work force moving forward into the future. The global public cloud Infrastructure is set to grow 35
          percent in 2021 with a major contributor being from the pandemic. And the global percentage of IT expenditure is
          tipped to grow 18 percent by the end of 2021. Again, facilitated by the workforces need for scalable infrastructure
          (Goodison, D 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
          For me personally, the cloud revolution will have an impact on my virtual life. Although I do not exclusively rely on
          any one cloud provider. I have different accounts for different data. I have more important documents and photos
          backed up in Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud, as well as my all-University related files and Assignments backed up in a
          seperate student OneDrive account. I also use Google Drive to back up some files against my Gmail account. The
          reason for my google drive account, is simple. It is compatibility. Google drive is much more compatible with
          android phones and chrome than OneDrive is. And perhaps this is where the cloud-based loyalties for most people
          will end up. Their choice of mobile phone, Laptop or smart device will ultimately decide which cloud-based service
          is used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cloud based technology will increase its presence in my life as I continue to study from home. Using SaaS technology
          (Software as a service) in Canvas, RMIT’s online learning tool. Microsoft’s office suite in which all academic work
           will be drafted, perfected and published. And using Atom (a widely used code editor published by Git Hub) to code
           test and develop different programming projects required by my studies.
        </p>
        <p>
          As these cloud-based services develop, we may see a fourth or fifth dimension added to cloud-based providers ability.
          Perhaps a 3D development machine will be added, and it will be called 3D as a service. Regardless of the purpose of
          development in cloud technology, it will continue to create employment for IT professionals. The industry will grow
          to create more and physical cloud locations. Which in turn will create jobs for construction and Infrastructure
          divisions. As well as IT professionals to create the technology and maintain these locations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, we find that Cloud services, although already well established, will continue to see growth in this
          technology as businesses continue to outsource part, if not all, of their IT Infrastructures to Cloud giants like
          Google and Microsoft. And with this growth I hope to see further innovation and development of the services and
          security they provide.

        <h1>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices</h1>
        <p>By Justin Healy</p>
        <p>
          In our new world of the ‘Internet of Things’, we have seen the rise of small, completely programmable, home computing
          devices. With these devices we can create new home modern conveniences, create and develop new technologies, redesign
          old ones and educate the youth to the wonders of hardware and software design. The most popular among these home
          computing devices are the Raspberry Pi, The Arduino and Makey Makeys. There are other makes of devices but for the
          purposes of this essay we will concentrate on these three creations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we delve into the devices themselves, we should first have an understanding of the purpose of their existence.
          That purpose is their place in the world of the ‘Internet of things’(IOT). Modern households are awash with computing
          devices. From washing machines, fridges, home security systems, Tv’s, bathrooms and even toilets being made capable
          of being fitted with some sort of computing device which make decisions based on behavior. This behavior may be the
          pressing of a button, closing of a door or simply walking into a room. However, to be considered as an IOT device it
          will have to satisfy at least one of the following three criteria. The first; the device must have networking capability whereby it will be able speak to another device and exchange information. This could be a connection through Wi-Fi, remote cloud, or a local server. The second; the device must be able to sense something in its environment. For example, it could sense whether a door has been opened, a person has entered the room or simply the absence of either. The third: the device would be able to actuate something. So, when they are triggered, the lights may turn on, the tv turned off or doors
          locked. These three criteria are the defining characteristics of an IOT device (Shovic 2016, p. 1 -2).
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what are small computing devices? They are a small(generally fit into a human hand) sized computer that can be
          programmed to do whatever its programmer can imagine and develop it to be. The capability of these devices varies.
          Some are severely basic and only capable of basic functions like on/off capability. And others are small personal
          computers with a built in Operating System which run just like a normal computer. They can handle mouse and keyboard
          input, stream movies and pretty much anything else a normal computer can do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Raspberry Pi’s are one of the most popular small computing devices on the market. They cost $35US and have USB3 ports,
          CPU, HDMI outputs and your choice of RAM size. 2GB, 4GB or 8GB. They also have 4k video capability. Sound familiar?
          Yes, they are just like a normal desktop computer only tinier and considerably cheaper. They also include a Linux
          based Operating System. Sales for these computers hit 640,000 units in March 2020 alone. This peak in sales has been
          attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, as people have been using these devices as cheap and
          efficient way of working and learning from home, as well as use in home IOT projects (Tung 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
          Arduinos and Makey Makeys are two other types of small computing device on the market right now. Arduinos are small
          open-source circuit boards which developers can use to create projects and IOT devices. They are known as a micro
          controller. They are more simplistic in comparison to the Raspberry Pi, in that they do not have built in Operating
          systems and will not function like a normal computer. But they can interact with devices around them or send
          information to your computer for analysis or storage. Some Arduinos even have Wi-Fi chips installed so they can
          interact directly with the cloud. This can make the information accessible to computers or mobile devices anywhere
          in the world. That is pretty handy for application development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Makey Makeys are an education based micro controller. They are simpler in design and functionality. And marketed, and
          often used, for classroom situations. They come with easy attachable alligator clips and how to books and video for
          getting started. These small devices are a great learning projects for children.
        </p>
        <p>
          The potential impact of these developments will be most felt by the owner of which ever device is chosen. As these
          products are essentially a blank canvas in which a person can develop their own modern convenience, the level of
          impact is relative to the capability of the creation. However, this is the direct impact of these devices. The more
          popular they become and more their use becomes part of the general knowledge of society, we should see a rise in
          these devices use and their capability.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the Raspberry Pi is so affordable and widely available it has become the brains of many inventions in recent years.
          A Robotics Engineer from California has recently created a ventilator machine using the Raspberry Pi in response to
          the Covid-19 pandemic. As these machines are in high demand as a treatment for suffering patients. Creations like
          this will the future of these products. Engineered and designed to fill gaps in the market. Or to create solutions
          to problems faced by the individual or the general population.
        </p>
        <p>
          How will this affect me? At this moment I do not own any of these devices, and their existence is something that I
          have only recently become familiar with. But they are something I will keep in mind next time a problem arises that
          I need to find a solution for through use of technology. To have these devices readily available and most importantly
          affordable gives me the chance to try out and to develop these ideas and tailor them to my own individual needs. And
          it is also possible that any IOT products available of the shelf that I may purchase in the future could use
          these technologies or have been originally developed with one of these technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the age of the Internet of Things these devices will pave the way to educate and enlighten the general population
          of the wonders of technology. These small devices have in a sense already replaced their larger and more expensive
          older siblings known as laptops and computer towers, as the Raspberry Pi 4 demonstrates. While they do not have near
          the same processing power as a top-of-the-line Laptop right now, if they continue their innovation, they may do in
          the future.
